*motivation**

* Organization is what makes us smart, efficient, kind, responsible, simply human.
* Research is the first and most important part of any project. This is where it starts, and defines the quaility of all that follows
* Research is how we learn and gain knowledge. If not organized, our we become ridden with dimentia. The mental rot that starts with you and invades our ccollective brain
* So, PLEASE, be organized in your research.

And now you can, with ease and growing respect and admiration for yourself, do three things at the same time. Yes, thats exactly what this organizational structure is designed for.

But thats not all if you get it, now:

**The pros:**

* you will have unburdened your overheated and manic brain into the structure that nicely extends your already organized brain
* you will stay focused on the subject
* while still allowed to stray in two tangential directions
    * of creating proposal outlines for ideas popping into you mind while doing research
        * for miracles that can be done now
        * and abstracts for
            * miracles you need help of your team later,
              NOTE: TODO be placed in abstracts for discussion bin of your organizational structure
* you will have a perfect record of all research you ever done
* with chronological markers
* structured by subjects
* instantly readable at a glance at the structure ,without openning a single file
* readily searchable by simple scripts, by a large set of search parameters
* Automated to the simple following sequence

**The cons:**

Are you serious??!!!

I dont know yet. This is my first try at it. Why dont you tell me how it went.

**The resulting awesome research workflow**
that comes after installing spiceResearchOrganizer browser extention

* write a short prompt for Claude
* hit return
* read the answer
* if not satisfied, refine your prompt
* when satisfied, think of a truthful but short phrase describing this research step
* remember this, as the name of the step, just for a sec
* click on spiceResearchOrganizer extention on browser top bar
* when pop-up window appears, type in your research step name
    * repeat process for the next step
    * till done

Well, that is not the end of the story.

**How to deal with those distracting ideas**

that keep popping into your overheated brain. As soon as fortunate event happens:
* go to your git structure, prbly cloned locally
* right click on research folder
* when menu pops up, click 'new proposal' item
* when submenu appears, chose between two available items
    * i know implementation outline
    * i have only abstract idea, but implementation is unclear
* depending on choice
    * chose between available implementation outline templates from next submenu
    * go to next step
* If your chosen #1 in the previous step, create implementation outline by filling out your chosen template. Be quick and dirty, you are at the danger zone to lose your focus and your mind. This is as far as I dare to go into that rabbit hole.
  If your chosen #2, quickly fill out motivation and abstract section of the template.
* This is just the beginning of your tangential trajectorie, for it has to be broken in a linear stepwise fashion, to be manageable by your overheating brain.
  Find a way to end your first try at a good spot, and quickly fill out roadmap secion at the bottom of the template
  with bullets of your remaining steps, that are quickly fading in the distant future
* When your brain cools down, come back and knock off a few more roadmap items by creating more files in the implementation receipe sequence.
* Oh no, you just realized that the idea you are working on is not a loner, but a family of related ideas. Thats great, you
  are earning your pay. Use automation bots provided to split that proposal file into a directory with the same name.
  The created directory will contain one file, the one you were working on, with the same name.
  Other files outlining remaining implementation steps will have same name with a sequence tag number added

**Test of concept.**

Iv created this entire system
* using this system
* while doing my first research
* with the two tools i most familiar with
* cloude ai
* git
extending my previous knowledge
so

i guess it works?
